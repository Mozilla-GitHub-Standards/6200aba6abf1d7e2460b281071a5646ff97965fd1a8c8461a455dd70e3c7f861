Heka
------

Use of the 'Heka' metrics and logging system can be configured in your sync
application's sync.conf file. You will need to add a section [heka_loader]
that looks something like this::

    [heka_loader]
    backend = services.metrics.HekaLoader
    config = /path/to/this/sync.conf

And also a [heka] section::

    [heka]
    sender_class = heka.senders.zmq.ZmqPubSender
    sender_bindstrs = tcp://localhost:5585

The [heka] section must define a set of keys prefixed with "sender_".  The
most important one of these is the "sender_class" which defines the classname
of the heka sender. All other 'sender_' prefixed keys will be passed into the
constructor of the sender with the prefix stripped away.

If these are left out, the heka client will default to passing messages to
Python's `logging` standard library module.

In either case, the heka client will be available from the application object
as the `logger` attribute. If you don't have access to the application object,
you can get the client from Heka's `CLIENT_HOLDER` object like so::

    from heka.holder import CLIENT_HOLDER
    logger = CLIENT_HOLDER.default_client
